    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 cup (227g) sourdough starter</li>
      <li>1 cup (113g) flout (any kind)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>4 tbsp butter (unsalted)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp dried herbs (any kind)</li>
      <li>Oil, for brushing</li>
      <li>Course salt for sprinkling on top</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="preparation">Preparation</h2>
    <ol class="preparation">
      <li>Mix together the sourdough starter, flour, salt, butter and herbs.The dough should be smooth and cohesive, and not sticky.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a small rectangular slab. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until the dough is firm.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Lightly flour two pieces of parchment paper, the dough slabs, and your rolling pin.</li>
      <li>Place one piece of dough onto each floured piece of parchment paper and roll each until they are an even 1/16" thick. </li>
      <li>Transfer each dough sheet (including parchment paper) onto baking sheets. Lightly brush the dough sheets with oil and sprinkle salt on top.</li>
      <li>Cut each dough sheet into 1 1/4" squares using a pizza roller.</li>
      <li>Prick each cracker a couple times with a fork to prevent them from puffing up as they bake.</li>
      <li>Bake the crackers for 20-25 minutes, until they're starting to brown around the edges. Midway through, rotate the baking sheets to help them brown evenly.</li>
      <li>When fully browned, remove the crackers from the oven and place the pans on a rack to cool.</li>
      <li>Store crackers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ol>
